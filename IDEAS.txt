Ok, so combining 2 things I generally loathe, pinball and crafting.
Death to this theme.

PINCRAFT
========

Simple pinball table based on a very old board, in sources.
Nothing overly special about it.
The bumpers, instead of score, hand out crafting materials.

What can we craft?
------------------

- additional bumpers for different materials
	- you start with just 1 bumper / material
	- this is kind of like a clicker game, but then with pinball
		- I really hate clicking games, buddha this f'ing theme
- death shield in the bottom
- extra ball / life
- multi-ball
	- essentially, the bonuses you would get normally through
	  play have to be crafted. If I make this grindy I could
	  add lootboxes to have the mother of all horrors, THIS THEME

What is the goal of the game?
-----------------------------

- normally, goal of pinball is just Stayin' Alive, ah ah ahhh.
- and get a high score
	- OK, I said no score but in addition to materials let's
	  award points.
- simple server to record scores?
	- some basic punkbuster tech
	- record all actions and send those as payload i/o score
	- not too worried about 3733T H@><0RZ
- if I have more time (HAH) I can always add something else.
- crafting materials needed for player bonuses increase over time?
	- levelling?

Assets
------

- the board, bunch of models for borders
	- ratio: 1 wide by 2 deep
	- bg texture: 512 by 1024
	- angle of table between 3.5 and 7 degrees
		- old tables used 3.5
		- newer 6.5 to 7, because economics
- whole bunch of non-mesh colliders, mostly spheres and boxes
  for both efficiency and accuracy
- ball with metal material
	- ball is 27mm diameter and weighs 80 grams
	- entry tube 30mm wide?
- everything should have very small friction
- flippers
- bumpers

- camera looks down, sees entire board at -45ish degree angle
	- does not move
	- board on left side of screen
- craft UI is HTML
	- right side of screen
	- some styles buttons and other elements
	- maybe some fancy CSS animations, ooh
	- make sure button downs don't block UI or something

Worries
-------

- flippers: need some kind of joint / movement restriction
	>>>>>>> I KNEW IT, TOOK MANY HOURS OF MY LIFE,... anyway, works
- bumpers, react with force on ball
- make sure ball doesn't get stuck due to friction or something
	- add tilt control
